\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The user interface of eMall is a mobile application, with an easy to use design.
It should be available on every major mobile operating system.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The system is fully operated on the Internet, so it doesn't feature any hardware interface, apart from the mobile device needed to access the service.
%\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The main communication interfaces of the platform are the users and CPMSs.
The system interacts with users to receive booking requests or to send information, and to CPMSs to receive information about charging stations or to remotely interact with the charging socket.
A different interface is when the system sends push notifications to a user or retrieves the users' location, charging status and schedule.

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Use case tables}
\subsubsection{Sequence diagrams}
This section shows all sequence diagrams related to the use cases. In all cases we consider that the actor has already logged in, except in the diagrams representing the registration and the login in operations.
\subsubsection{Requirements}
%TODO write requirements and map them with goals and domain assumptions
\subsubsection{Traceability Matrix}
%TODO mapping between requirements and use cases
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards Compliance}
\subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
\subsubsection{Any Other Constraint}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system must prevent downtime, in order to let Customers to charge their vehicle in every moment. At the same time CPO must be granted to access the system and perform their actions all the time.
To guarantee that the system is up most of the time, preventive regular maintanance should be perfomed. To make the system 24/07 accesible the server could be duplicated and the duplicated one run in parallel. So that during failures and maintanance of one of them, users can access the other one.

\subsubsection{Security}
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
\subsubsection{Portability}
