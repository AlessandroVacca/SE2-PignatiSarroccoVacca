\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The user interface of eMall is a mobile application, with an easy to use design.
It should be available on every major mobile operating system.
On the other hand, the interface of the CPMS subsystem is a web application with a dashboard with all the available features.
It should be available on every major web browser.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The system is fully operated on the Internet, so it doesn't feature any hardware interface, apart from the device needed to access the service.
%\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The main communication interfaces of the platform are the users and CPOs.
The system interacts with users to receive booking requests or to send information, and to CPOs to let them select different charging station options.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

Performance requirements are not particularly critical for the system, but it is anyway desirable that the system has a good response time, which could be included between 0.1 and 2 seconds.
Otherwise, Customers and CPOs may think that the service is interrupted or does not work.
Moreover the system has to guarantee a good experience for all users, taking into account that not everyone has access to high speed internet. Therefore,
the system should minimize the amount of broadband needed in order to fully
download the content.
The server infrastructure will be designed to be scalable so that it will be possible to adapt it to
the increment of users when the application diffusion will increase.
Finally, the system should be able to handle many concurrent users, at least
100 000.
\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards Compliance}

The system must be compliant to the GDPR law, as it will mainly used in EU. \newline
Secure connections must be used for data comunicaction. \newline
Customers must accept and read the privacy policy during the sign-up phase.

\subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}

Each customer is required to have a smartphone device on which it is possible to install the eMall application. The device must have access to the internet. \newline
The CPO must have access to the internet using a web browser on a PC.  



\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{NFR\arabic*}:]
    \item \textbf{Reliability}\\
    The system must prevent downtime, in order to let Customers to charge their vehicle in every moment. At the same time CPO must be granted to access the system and perform their actions all the time.
    To guarantee that the system is up most of the time, preventive regular maintanance should be perfomed. To make the system 24/07 accesible the server could be duplicated and the duplicated one run in parallel. So that during failures and maintanance, of one of them, users can access the other one. 
    \item \textbf{Availability}\\
    Given the fact that eMall is not an emergency service or anything related to critical situations, the system must provide availability of 99.9\%. This means that the average time between the occurrence of a fault and service recovery (MTTR) has to be contained at around 0.365 days per year.
    \item \textbf{Security}\\
    The data provided by the users contain some sensitive information, so the security aspect cannot be underestimated. The central database must be protected with all the available measures to avoid any external or internal attack. The passwords inside the data store have to be encrypted and in case of password recovery, this must never be sent in clear.
    Communication between parties are encrypted and goes on a secure channel (through SSL protocol) to avoid traffic sniffing and spoofing, thus avoiding cheating attacks and guaranteeing privacy and consistency.
    \item \textbf{Maintainability}\\
    The system must guarantee a high level of maintainability. It must be designed in such a way that permits future addition of functionalities with minimum effort.
    Design techniques must in fact guarantee an high reusability. The code must be well documented and hard-coding must be avoided. A testing routine has to be provided and it has to cover at least 75\% of the entire codebase, excluding interfaces code.
    \item \textbf{Portability}\\
    The application must be developed for two different platforms: iOS and Android smartphones. The web application must run on any OS (like Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc) that supports a web browser. Even mobile devices like iPads and Android tablets must be able to access the web app.
\end{enumerate}
