\section{Introduction}
eMall (e-Mobility for All) is an easy-to-use application which intent is to help the user to recharge their electric vehicle in order to reduce our carbon footprint.
Users need an application whose main intent is to plan the charging process of an electric vehicle, thus reducing the interference and constraints on our daily schedule.
Charging Point Operators need an application to manage their charging stations. 
\subsection{Purpose}

The aim of the product is to simplify the process of electric vehicle charging, improving the customers' experience. Moreover the Charging Point Operators processes will be facilitated.
The experience will be enhanced because many aspects of the electric vehicle charging will be integrated and they will be located within a single service.
\\\\
The application should provide two types of accesses for Customers (people who need to charge their vehicles) and Charging Point Operators.
\\\\
Customers will have the possibility to see which charging stations are available nearby and to also know the charging cost and if they have special offers.
They will also have the opportunity to book a charge at a station at a certain timeframe in advance and to start the charging process remotely.
They will be notified when the process has finished and the car is fully charged, and they will be able to pay from the application.
Moreover, the eMall service has a smart system that suggests to the customer the optimal charging solution, based on their schedule, the charging cost and the current state of charge.
On the other hand Charging Point Operators will be able to select energy options and set special offers.
\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{G\arabic*:}]
        \item \textbf{Allow users to obtain information about nearby charging stations}
        \\
        The customer can view information about any nearby charging station,  
        such as charging cost and about special offers, availability of every type of charging socket, 
        and if a certain type of socket is occupied at the time,
         the estimated time for the first to be free.
        \item \textbf{Allow users to book a charge for a certain timeframe}
        \\
        The customer can select any available charging station and book the charging for a certain timeslot, if available. 
        \item \textbf{Allow users to start the charge}
        \\
        The customer can remotely start the charge once the electric car has been connected to the station's socket.
        \item \textbf{Allow the users to know when the charging has finished}
        \\
        The customer will be notified by the application when the charging of his vehicle has been completed.
        \item \textbf{Allow the users to pay for the charging service}
        \\
        The customer has the option to pay directly from the eMall application for the obtained service.
        \item \textbf{Allow the users to receive suggestions on where to charge}
        \\
        The customer can receive suggestions from eMall on the optimal station to charge, based on his schedule his vehicle's state of charge, the stations' prices and availability.
        %\item \textbf{Let the system to provide informations about charging stations}
        %\\
        
        \item \textbf{Allow Charging Point Operators to decide the energy acquisition options}
        \\
        The Charging Point Operator will have the possibility to choose wheter to aquire energy automatically or to acquire it manually from a specific energy provider.
        An other option will be to storage the energy into the batteries if they are presents.
        \item \textbf{Allow Charging Point Operators to dinamically choose the charging cost and to set offers}
        \\
        The Charging Point Operator will have the possibility to select the charging cost price based on the energy providers prices. They will also can set special offers based on the energy providers prices

\subsubsection{Phenomena}
According to the paper "The World and the Machine" by M.Jackson and P.Zave, 
we can identify the application domains. 
The following table describes the world, shared and the machine phenomena, 
including the reference to which part controls the phenomena.
