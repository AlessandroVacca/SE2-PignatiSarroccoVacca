\subsection{Product Perspective}
\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User wants to start using the eMall service}\\
    The user Matteo decides that he wants to use the eMall service to 
    take advantage of the efficiency it offers. 
    He launches the service and selects the option to sign up. 
    Matteo then inputs all the relevant information and he is granted access to the service.

    He selects a station, views all the station's information and then chooses a station according to his preferences and then finalizes the booking.
    The user then receives the socket's identification.
    \item \textbf{User starts the charge}\\
    The user Matteo drives to a station that he has a charge booked with, he then unlocks the booked socket from the service, he then connects his electric 
    vehicle to the socket and, after he has left the vehicle, he launches the eMall service and 
    he is presented with the option to start the vehicle's charge. He selects this option and the station initiates charging on the booked socket. eMall than shows the user the estimated time for the full charge of the vehicle. 
    \item \textbf{User is notified of a finished charge}\\
    After the user Matteo has started to charging process at the station,
     he goes to a nearby cafeteria to have a cup of coffee. When the car has fully charge, the eMall service notifies him on his phone with a push notification.
    \item \textbf{User pays for the service}\\
